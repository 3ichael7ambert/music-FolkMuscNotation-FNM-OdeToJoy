# Folk Music Notation

I love to make music and I love to program.
So how about we make music with programming languages?

```ly
% Folk Music Notation
% Title: Scarborough Fair
% Composer: Traditional

M: 4/4
L: 1/4
Q: 1/4=100
K: Em

G G | A A | G E | D2 |
E E | D D | C D | E2 |
```

This example shows a simple FNM file but it is used for Folk Music Notation.
